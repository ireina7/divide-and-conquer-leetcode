# divide-and-conquer-leetcode
*Divide and conquer all leetcode problems.*  
![](https://us-central1-progress-markdown.cloudfunctions.net/progress/10)

## Introduction
Every one trys to learn various methods to solve leetcode problems.
However, few people grasp the core of all algorithms and 
therefore most of us cannot solve novel problems we didn't seen before.

To overcome all these problems, 
I want to have a experiment on **solving every leetcode problem with divide and conquer**.
If I can prove this, give me your star;
If I fail, no regret.

## Spirit
- Use `divide-and-conquer`.
- Ok if pass all leetcode tests.
- Solutions should obey complexity (time and space) constraints of the problem (if any).

## Setting
To be practical, I shall use `Java`, `C++`, `Go` and `TypeScript` (`JavaScript` as *subset* of `TypeScript`) 
for all experiments (although `Scala` and `Rust` are better?).

The world has not been prepared for everything.
- *Java* is terrible in the field of *abstraction* and *expression*.
- *C++* is terrible at *clean abstraction* and full of traps.
- *Go* is fine but lack higher-rank-polymorphism(generic method), but still can be used to model...
- *TypeScript* lacks *Higher-kinded types*.
