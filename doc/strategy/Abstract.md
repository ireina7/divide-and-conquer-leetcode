# Divide and Conquer!

Nearly all problems can be solved by `divide-and-conquer`.

## General divide and conquer
Suppose some situation of a problem, we model its solution as a function with the format of:
```java
class Solution<Answer, A, B, C> {
    Answer solve(A a, B b, C... ps);
}
```
Then how can we solve it?
The answer may be surprising: just <u>divide the parameters</u>.
