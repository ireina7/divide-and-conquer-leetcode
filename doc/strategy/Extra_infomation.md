# Extra infomation in recursion
> It's time for data structures!

When using recursion to implement divide-and-conquer strategy, we need extra infomation to help complement result.
One may ask 'what kind of extra info do we need?' and the answer is 'it depends'.

## Single value
### Index

## Products

## List or slice
### Ordered

## Priority heap

## Hash map
